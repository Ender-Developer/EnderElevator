**EnderElevator** is a Hytale mod that introduces a dynamic elevator system, allowing for practical and fluid vertical transportation between floors.

## 🚀 Features

* **Seamless Vertical Travel:** Teleport instantly between floors.
* **Simple Controls:**
    * **Jump (Space):** Teleport to the next elevator block directly **above** you.
    * **Crouch (Ctrl):** Teleport to the next elevator block directly **below** you.
* **Safety Mechanics:** The system checks if there is sufficient space (2 blocks high) at the destination before teleporting the player, preventing suffocation or getting stuck.
* **Distance:** As long as the blocks are aligned on the same X and Z coordinates, the distance between floors does not matter.

## 🛠️ Crafting

Currently, the **Ender Elevator** block can be crafted using the **Furniture Bench** (Textiles category).

**Recipe:**
* **8x** White Wool
* **1x** Life Essence
